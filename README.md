**`Software Engineer`**

I am a software developer who is a student at Hunter College. I started my programming journey when I was 12 in technology class. I built my first website (a connection page for my online video game group), and since then I was hooked. I love to use code to help the user have the best experience. I believe that software is a product that, if leveraged well, can improve people's quality of life and make it easier. My interests lie in Data Analysis, with past experience working with the NYC Government. Apart from my coursework, I also like to play soccer (played on my schools team) and read.
